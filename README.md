# scarcity-timer
This is a concept used by internet marketers to give the illusion of a product being available for a limited time only. I wanted to test my new knowledge of JQuery, and JS Timing Events to try and build my own version. The code resets once it reaches zero.

Iteration 1 - Make it automatically countdown for 24 Hours (DONE - 07/26/2018)

Iteration 2 - Allow users to input a custom amount of time to countdown from; max time is 30 days

Iteration 3 - store session in browser or store IP, so that user will see the same countdown across devices
