# scarcity-timer
This is a concept used by internet marketers to give the illusion of a product being available for a limited time only.
Examples:

- [Hurrify](https://apps.shopify.com/hurrify-countdown-timer)
- [Page Expiration Robot](http://www.pageexpirationrobot.com/)

I wanted to test my new knowledge of JQuery, and JS Timing Events to try and build my own version.

0.1.0 - Initial build
- [ x ] (07/26/2018)

0.1.2 - Allow users to input a custom amount of time to countdown from
- [ x ] (11/22/2018)







Ideas:
- Store session in browser or store IP, so that user will see the same countdown across devices
- Give option to choose what to do once timer reaches end of countdown, restart time? display image? redirect to link?
