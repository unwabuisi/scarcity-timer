# scarcity-timer
This is a concept used by internet marketers to give the illusion of a product being available for a limited time only. I wanted to test my new knowledge of JQuery, and JS Timing Events to try and build my own version. The code resets once it reaches zero.

0.1.0 - Make it automatically countdown for 24 Hours
- [ x ] (07/26/2018)

0.1.2 - Allow users to input a custom amount of time to countdown from
- [ x ] (11/22/2018)



Ideas:
- store session in browser or store IP, so that user will see the same countdown across devices
- Give option to choose what to do once timer reaches end of countdown, restart time? display image? redirect to link?
