# scarcity-timer
This is a concept used by internet marketers to give the illusion of a product being available for a limited time only.
Examples:

- [Hurrify](https://apps.shopify.com/hurrify-countdown-timer)
- [Page Expiration Robot](http://www.pageexpirationrobot.com/)

I wanted to test my new knowledge of JQuery, and JS Timing Events to try and build my own version.

Ideas:
- [] Store session in browser or store IP, so that user will see the same countdown across devices
- [] Find a way to hold timer data in a separate database and display timer through an iframe to be placed on multiple sites


### Release Notes:

**0.1.0 - 07/26/2018**
- Initial build

**0.1.2 - 11/22/2018**
- Allow users to input a custom amount of time to countdown from

**0.1.3 - 01/24/2020**
* Users can choose what timer will do once countdown is finished
	* Do nothing
	* Display a picture (ex: SALE HAS ENDED)
	* Redirect to another webpage
